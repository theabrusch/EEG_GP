Spatial features:
------------------------------------------------------------
(SAD) Spatial average difference (Mognon et al., 2010). 
This feature is defined as the absolute value of the mean of 
frontal electrode activations minus the absolute value of 
the mean of posterior electrode activations. The frontal area 
is defined to be the electrodes with absolute angles less 
than 60° and radii larger than 0.4. The posterior area 
consists of the electrodes with absolute angles larger than 
110°.

(centralActivation) Logarithm of mean of absolute values of
activations of central electrodes of IC (Winkler et al., 2011).

(central) Thesefeatures give the absolute values of the mean 
activations of electrodes in various areas of the scalp. Each 
area is defined as the mean over all electrodes, where the 
contribution from each electrode to the mean is weighted by a 
Gaussian bell. For the areas around the eyes (lefteye and 
righteye), the standard deviation of the Gaussian bell is 1 
cm. For all other areas, it is 2 cm. A 9-cm radius of the scalp 
is assumed. The Gaussian bells are centered at the locations of 
Fp1, Fp2, AFz, Cz, POz, C5, and C4, respectively.

(zcoord) X,Y,and Z coordinates of dipole fit.

(SED) Spatial eye difference (Mognon et al., 2010). Absolute 
value of the difference between activation of electrodes around 
the left and right eye areas. The left eye area is defined to 
lie between the angles −61° and −35° with a radius larger than 
0.3 (where the head radius is assumed to be one, the convention 
in EEGLAB). The right eye area is defined to lie between the 
angles 34° and 61°, also at a radius larger than 0.3. Zero 
degrees is towards the nose and positive 90° is at the right 
ear.

(logRangeSpatial) Logarithm of range of activation of 
electrodes. This was one of the six final features included in 
the classifier described in Winkler et al., 2011.

(spatDistExtrema) Euclidean distance in 3D coordinates between
the two electrodes with minimal and maximal activation.

(cdn) Current density norm (Winkler et al., 2011). The current 
density norm is a measure of the complexity of the current 
source distribution of an IC. A high complexity of the current 
source distribution indicates that the source of the IC is 
difficult to locate inside the brain, and thus that it is likely 
to be an artifact. This was one of the six final features 
included in the classifier described in Winkler and colleagues 
(2011), in which a more detailed description can be found.

(dipoleResidualVariance) Residual variance of dipole fit.

Temporal features
--------------------------------------------------------------
(logRangeTemporalVar) The range (maximum value minus minimum 
value) was calculated for 1-s intervals. The feature 
logRangeTemporalVar is the variance.

(var1sAvg) Again, the variance is found in 1-s intervals of 
the time series. The features var1sAvg and var1sVar are the 
average and variance over these intervals, respectively. 
This was also used in Winkler et al. (2011).

(timeEntropyAvg) In each 1-s interval, the entropy was found. 
The average over these intervals is timeEntropyAvg and the 
variance is timeEntropyVar. This was also used in Winkler et 
al. (2011).

Spectral features
--------------------------------------------------------------
(theta) Mean over 1-s intervals of the logarithm of band power 
in the θ (4–7 Hz).
The average band power in the α-band was one of the six final 
features included in the classifier described in 
(Winkler et al., 2011).

(lowFrequentPowerAvg) This features give the band power in the 
δ band (1–3 Hz) relative to the total power in the time series. 
The spectrogram used for these features is calculated based on 
the downsampled but unfiltered time series since the filter 
removes frequencies lower than 3 Hz. The spectrogram is 
calculated over 1-s intervals, and the power in the δ band 
divided by the power over all frequencies is then found. The 
feature lowFrequentPowerAvg is the mean over the 1-s intervals 
of this ratio.
