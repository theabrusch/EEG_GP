title: 'The ICLabel Dataset of electroencephalographic (EEG) independent component (IC) features'
description: 'A dataset of spatiotemporal features calculated of electroencephalographic (EEG) independent components (IC). Includes features from over 200,000 ICs. Crowdsourced labels exist for more than 8,000 ICs. A test set of 130 ICs has labels estimated from suggest classifications submitted by six expert human IC labelers. '
